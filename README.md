# AMM-Backed Margin Trading + Binary Options Protocol  

## üìñ Definition  

**An on-chain leveraged trading and binary options protocol that integrates AMMs as the source of real liquidity.**  

- Traders can open **leveraged positions** on spot assets without synthetic markets or funding rates.  
- Users can also take **binary option bets** on asset price direction within a time window.  
- LPs act as **passive margin lenders + binary options liquidity providers**, earning yield without taking directional AMM risk or impermanent loss.

## üîë Key Components  

1. **Real AMM Liquidity**  
   - All leveraged trades and option settlements execute **1:1 against AMMs (Uniswap, Curve)**.  
   - No virtual books or synthetic pricing.  

2. **Margin Lending Pool (LPs)**  
   - LPs deposit **stablecoins** into a unified pool.  
   - Funds are used for:  
     - Leveraged traders (borrow margin)  
     - Binary options payouts (if users win)  
   - LPs earn:  
     - **Borrow interest** from traders  
     - **Losing option stakes** from binary options  
   - **No directional exposure or impermanent loss.**  

3. **Leveraged Traders**  
   - Deposit collateral + borrow margin from pool.  
   - Positions are **physically backed** in AMMs.  
   - Pay **interest** to pool and face liquidation if value < threshold.  

4. **Binary Options Users**  
   - Place a **directional bet** (UP/DOWN) on an asset with defined expiry & payout.  
   - If correct ‚Üí protocol pays them from the pool.  
   - If wrong ‚Üí their stake goes to the pool (LPs earn).  
   - Gasless execution via **1inch limit order protocol** for settlement.  

5. **Liquidation & Settlement Engine**  
   - For margin trades ‚Üí monitors PnL and liquidates undercollateralized positions.  
   - For binary options ‚Üí fetches final price from an oracle and resolves outcome, filling 1inch orders only if user wins.

## üéØ Similarities / Differences  

- ‚úÖ Similar to **Aave + Uniswap**, but integrated into a single margin+options layer.
